Bolierplate code for building production ready [React](https://reactjs.irg) app using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

Also contains CSS styling using [Semantic-UI-React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/)

## Scripts

`npm run dev` Runs `next` which starts Next.js in development mode at http://localhost:3000.  
`npm run build` Runs `next` build which builds the application for production usage.
`npm start` Runs next start which starts a Next.js production server

## Notes

To start developing your application run `npm run dev`. This starts the development server on http://localhost:3000.

Visit http://localhost:3000 to view your application.

So far, we get:

Automatic compilation and bundling (with webpack and babel)
Hot code reloading
Static generation and server-side rendering of ./pages/
Static file serving. ./public/ is mapped to /

## Using PM2

#### for development

`pm2 start npm --name "your-app-name" -- run dev`

##### for production

`npm run build pm2 start npm --name "your-app-name" -- start`
